Fasetto is my other company that I am a co-founder of with a good friend called Coy. We setup fasetto to make the world better by solvingq problems people have and making software work for us to give us better live's.

Fasetto started off helping the education world with plans to improve school environments in America.

We then moved into mobile application development and paperless software aimed at improving communication and eco friendliness.

Right now the main focus and drive of Fasetto is in the Link product coming out in early 2018. 

To find out more, say, what is link, or, what else can I ask, or if that is all say, stop.
