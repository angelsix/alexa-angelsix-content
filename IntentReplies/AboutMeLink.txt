Let me introduce you to Link. It combines cutting edge software and embedded hardware in a tiny package. Think of it as your offline cloud.

All files, data, photos, videos, code that you have on your computer, phone or other device instantly stores on Link and is accessible by all of your devices instantly, without the need for copy/paste, wires or any actions.

Your existing devices can only hold so much. The network can only reach so far. Link bridges these gaps in connectivity and capacity by housing your entire digital world in one ultra-portable, always-available device.

With up to 2TB, the pint-sized LINK can handle a sea of data, boasting greater storage capacity than your laptop, phone, and tablet combined.
