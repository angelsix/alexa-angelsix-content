I get asked a lot about myself. As I am not one to post socially or talk much about myself, most people only find out from asking my directly.

Firstly, my name is Luke. I develop software and hardware systems in a huge variety of areas.

Having taught myself C back in 1997 when I was 10, and since learned over 40 languages on many platforms, programming comes as natural as speaking english. This allows me to focus on the task of solving the problem at hand.

When asked to describe myself and what I do, it is hard to say. I do a lot of things. Mostly things that interest me. I am one of those people who thrives for mental stimulation. I prefer watching QI over Master Chef. I guess the short answer is I work for myself, running one or more companies at a time, usually in the software and hardware sectors.

To find out more, say, tell me more, or if that is all say, stop.
